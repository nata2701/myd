Unfortunately, the provided contexts do not directly relate to calculating the square of a planet. They discuss programming to calculate the square of a number, but not specifically for a celestial body like a planet. However, I can provide a general Python code snippet for calculating the square of a number, which you could potentially adapt for your purposes.

Here's a Python program to calculate the square of a given number:

```python
def calculate_square(number):
    return number ** 2

# Example usage
number = 9
square = calculate_square(number)
print("The square of", number, "is", square)
```

In this example, the `calculate_square` function takes a number as an argument, raises it to the power of 2 (i.e., squares it), and returns the result. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a specific number (in this case, 9).

To adapt this code for calculating the square of a planet's distance from the sun, you would need to replace the `number` variable with the actual distance value. However, this would likely require additional calculations and data, as planetary distances are not simple numbers.
